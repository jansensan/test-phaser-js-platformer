# Phaser JS Platformer

This project has been created to discover how to create a platformer game with the [Phaser JS library](http://phaser.io/). In order to test this, I have recreated/adapted the layout of the first level of the old NES [Bubble Bobble](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_Bobble) game.

The layout of the level itself has been created with the Tiled map editor. I have put in place one player and one type of enemy. Their behaviour is similar to the original game, however they differ slightly. Veteran players will notice but, I hope, will not be offended.
